# üõ†Ô∏è Modular Test Case for Electronics & Prototyping

This modular test module is designed as a universal interface for developing, debugging, and showcasing electronics projects. Whether you're working with microcontrollers like the ESP32 or testing your own PCBs, this box is your new best friend on the bench.

## üîå Features

- Large rotary knobs for simulating analog input (e.g., potentiometers or encoders)
- LED bar & dot matrix display for visual output feedback
- Joystick & arcade-style buttons for interactive testing or UI prototyping
- Toggle switches to simulate system states or input conditions
- BNC & XLR connectors for quick interfacing with test gear
- Colored panel-mount buttons for clear visual signaling
- 3D-printed housing with an industrial look and sturdy mounting
- Interchangeable panels for experimenting with case layout

## üß© Modularity & Customization

The design is fully modular ‚Äî components can be swapped, extended or adapted.  
You can 3D print custom brackets and component fittings for your own electronics (Arduino, ESP32, etc.), and glue them directly into the case for a clean, secure fit.

## üñ®Ô∏è Print Info

- All parts were 3D printed using a Bambu Lab X1 Carbon.
- The case & panels are printed in PLA.
- Use M3 bolts to easily lock the panels in place.

## üéØ Use Cases

Perfect for:

- STEM education
- Electronics workshops
- Industrial simulation
- Game controller prototyping
- IoT development
- Any hands-on testing setup üí°

üí° Got ideas for upgrades? Think OLED displays, RFID readers, piezo buzzers, or even haptic feedback. This build is ready to evolve.

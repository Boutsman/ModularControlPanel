Modular Test Case for Electronics &amp; Prototyping

🛠️ Modular Test Case for Electronics & Prototyping
This modular test module is designed as a universal interface for developing, debugging, and showcasing electronics projects. Whether you're working with microcontrollers like the ESP32 or testing your own PCBs, this box is your new best friend on the bench.

🔌 Features
Large rotary knobs for simulating analog input (e.g., potentiometers or encoders)
LED bar & dot matrix display for visual output feedback
Joystick & arcade-style buttons for interactive testing or UI prototyping
Toggle switches to simulate system states or input conditions
BNC & XLR connectors for quick interfacing with test gear
Colored panel-mount buttons for clear visual signaling
3D-printed housing with an industrial look and sturdy mounting
Interchangable panels for experimenting with case layout.
🧩 Modularity & Customization
The design is fully modular – components can be swapped, extended or adapted.
You can 3D print custom brackets and component fittings for your own electronics, like Arduino or Esp32, and glue them directly into the case for a clean, secure fit.

🖨️ Print Info
All parts were 3D printed using a Bambu Lab X1 Carbon. The case & panels are printed in PLA.
Use M3 bolts to easily lock the panels in place.

🎯 Use Cases
Perfect for:

STEM education
Electronics workshops
Industrial simulation
Game controller prototyping

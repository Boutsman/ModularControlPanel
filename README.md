## 🔌 Features

- Large rotary knobs for simulating analog input (e.g., potentiometers or encoders)
- LED bar & dot matrix display for visual output feedback
- Joystick & arcade-style buttons for interactive testing or UI prototyping
- Toggle switches to simulate system states or input conditions
- BNC & XLR connectors for quick interfacing with test gear
- Colored panel-mount buttons for clear visual signaling
- 3D-printed housing with an industrial look and sturdy mounting
- Interchangeable panels for experimenting with case layout

## 🧩 Modularity & Customization

The design is fully modular — components can be swapped, extended or adapted.  
You can 3D print custom brackets and component fittings for your own electronics, like Arduino or ESP32, and glue them directly into the case for a clean, secure fit.

The case design is fully parametric, allowing you to easily adapt the size of the enclosure:

- **userWidth**: total width of the case (defines how many slots your panel can take)
- **userDepth**: total depth of the case

> Note: The panel height is fixed at 100 mm — only width and depth are adjustable via parameters.
